# coarse2fine
We run experiments on 24 randomly selected categories in Wikipedia. The 24 categories are under 6 major topics (Electronics, Machinery, Vehicle, Art & Literature, Enter- tainment, Food), each topic contains 4 coarse-grained cat- egories. We use DBpedia 2015-10 version (A knowledge base derived from Wikipedia infoboxes) as our source of at- tributes and values. To reduce noise, we filter out attributes that appear in less than 5% of entities.
